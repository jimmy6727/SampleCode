# SampleCode
A portfolio of code samples to showcase my work for potential employers and other showcasing purposes.

If you are a potential employer visiting this repository in order to view my work, thank you for your interest! Below is a 
description of all the files in this repository, some of which were written in an academic setting, and some of which is portions of 
other people's work that I added onto, modified, or otherwise contributed to (I give credit to any additional authors whenever 
necessary).

Thank you for visiting this sample page.


# NLP
The NLP folder contains some examples of work done for my Fall 2019 Natural Language Processing class at Whitman College. Included is an n-gram language model that can distinugish between authors of different text, and a hidden markov probability model that uses n-grams and part of speech tags to predict the likelihood of a given sequence of words and corresponding part of speech tags.

# ReactLax
The ReactLax folder contains some samples of the logic behind React Lacrosse's fifth generation face off machine prototype. Some of this was written by contributors at cadmodels.com and modified/debugged/troubleshooted as needed.

# CS3301MOM
This folder contains a message oriented project completed for my Spring 2019 Component Technologies and Microservices class at University of St Andrews in St. Andrews, Scotland. It is intended to be a simulated backend for the pseudo-Uber App in the UberJimApp folder. It includes a consumer and a producer client for producing and consuming messages between driver, rider, and Uber's systems, as well as the pdf report/reflection I wrote describing it in further detail.

# UberJimApp
The UberJimApp folder contains the pseudo-Uber app I built for my Spring 2019 Component Technologies and Microservices class at University of St Andrews in St. Andrews, Scotland. It is written in Java using Android Studio and runs on android devices. It can get your current location and destination location, locate the nearest driver and corresponding driver profile, simulate trip, calculate trip statistics including distance and cost, and allows rider to leave a review for the driver.
