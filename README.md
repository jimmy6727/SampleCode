# SampleCode
A portfolio of code samples to showcase my work for potential employers and other showcasing purposes.

If you are a potential employer visiting this repository in order to view my work, thank you for your interest! Below is a 
description of all the files in this repository, some of which were written in an academic setting, and some of which is portions of 
other people's work that I added onto, modified, or otherwise contributed to (I give credit to any additional authors whenever 
necessary).

Thank you for visiting this sample page.
